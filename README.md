# Paylocity FE Challenge App

This is a Healthcare Benefits React app I built for the Paylocity Front-End Challenge.
You can try it live here: [https://paylocity-fe-challenge.netlify.app/](https://paylocity-fe-challenge.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## How It Works

This is a client-side React app that simulates a simple employee healthcare benefits management tool.

- On first load, it checks if thereâ€™s any existing employee data in `localStorage`.
- If none exists, it uses `faker-js` to generate mock employees and dependents, then stores them in `localStorage`.
- Any changes you make are automatically persisted in `localStorage`.
- To refresh with a new dataset, simply delete the `employeeData` key in `localStorage` and reload the app.
